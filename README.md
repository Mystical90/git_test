After finishing the first part of the Web development 101 course, I'm now doing my first web development project.

This project is meant as an excercise to enhance my skills and further my knowledge base with regards to coding.

My learning objectives are:
- Building the google homepage
- Understanding how each element is coded and how to move elements within a page.
